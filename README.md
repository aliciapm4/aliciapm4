## Hi there 👋

🎓 Senior at the University of Texas at Dallas, studying Computer Engineering  
💻 Aspiring Engineer and AI/Machine Learning Enthusiast    

I'm a motivated and analytical student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas. With a strong passion for technology and its real-world applications, I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skills in the AI field. I'm a quick learner with a logical mindset, committed to delivering high-quality work and contributing positively to any team. My enthusiasm for innovation drives me to seek opportunities where I can grow professionally, apply my academic learning, and make meaningful contributions to the industry.  

As a **Break Through Tech Fellow**, I developed strong communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills while working on collaborative tech projects. This experience reflects my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth beyond coding.

## 👩🏼‍💻 Recent Project: Income Classification with U.S. Census Data
**- What We Did:**
Cleaned and prepared a 1994 U.S. Census dataset to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K/year. Handled missing data, performed one-hot encoding for categorical features, scaled numerical features, and addressed class imbalance. Built and compared multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

**- Tools:**
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**- Result:**
Achieved 87% accuracy and a ROC AUC score of 0.92 using Gradient Boosting, outperforming baseline models and capturing key income-related patterns across demographics. The model can be leveraged for financial profiling, marketing segmentation, and social policy planning.
